# Data-Analytics

1. Relational Theory:
Design a 5th degree normalized database model for the following flat information. Use
as many tables as you feel is required. Indicate all primary and foreign key constraints.
Show all required SQL to create your database model.

Fields in file solarareadata.txt:
[SiteName, SiteAddress, SiteCity, PanelNum, PanelWatts, SensorNum, SensorTemp,
SensorIrradiance, Date, Time]

This is the output of solar-energy plants for a metro area. There are four plants. Each
plant has sensors distributed throughout the facility measuring local conditions. Also,
each PV panel measures the total watts it is producing at the time of the sample. The
data was previously collected and assembled in a file by someone who didnâ€™t
understand relational theory, so all the data has been placed into a single comma-
delimited file.
